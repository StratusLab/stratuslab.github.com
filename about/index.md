StratusLab started as an informal collaboration in 2008 between
several academic partners to investigate using cloud resources for
providing grid services.  It later evolved into a project co-funded by
the European Commission consisting of six partners (CNRS, UCM, GRNET,
SixSq, TID, and TCD) in five countries.  The StratusLab project ran
from June 2010 to May 2012 and produced the StratusLab cloud
distribution.

StratusLab is now an open collaboration of interested institutes and
individuals that provide resources to continue the evolution and
support of site running a StratusLab cloud.  If you want to join the
collaboration, please contact us at contact@stratuslab.eu.
