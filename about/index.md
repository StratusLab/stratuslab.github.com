StratusLab grew from an informal, academic collaboration in 2008 into
a formal project ([website archive](/fp7/index.html)), co-funded by
the European Commission, to develop an open source **IaaS cloud
distribution**.

Now, StratusLab is an **open collaboration** of institutes (CNRS,
SixSq, GRNET, and TCD) and individuals that continue to evolve the
software and provide support for StratusLab sites and users.  Contact
us at [contact@stratuslab.eu](mailto:contact@stratuslab.eu) to **join
the collaboration**.
