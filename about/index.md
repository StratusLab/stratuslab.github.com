StratusLab started as an informal, academic collaboration in 2008 to
investigate using cloud resources for providing grid services.  That
initiative evolved into the StratusLab project, co-funded by the
European Commission and consisting of six partners (CNRS, UCM, GRNET,
SixSq, TID, and TCD).  This two-year project produced the **StratusLab
cloud distribution**.  (See the [website archive](/fp7/index.html) for
more information.)

StratusLab is now an **open collaboration** of institutes and
individuals that continue to evolve the software and provide support
for StratusLab sites and users.  Contact us at
[contact@stratuslab.eu](mailto:contact@stratuslab.eu) to **join the
collaboration**.
