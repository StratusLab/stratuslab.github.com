StratusLab supports the deployment of private, community, and public
cloud infrastructures.  The software is designed to be easy to install
and to support commodity hardware, but remains flexible to meet the
constraints of existing sites.  A StratusLab cloud can be deployed on
as few as two physical machines.  (Or even one with some VM trickery!)

See the documents below for installing the software from binary
packages.  Source code and manual installation instructions are
available from our [GitHub
repositories](https://github.com/StratusLab).
