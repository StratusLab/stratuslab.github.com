StratusLab supports the deployment of **private**, **community**, and
**public** cloud infrastructures.  The software is designed to be
**easy to install** on support **commodity hardware**, but remains
flexible to meet the constraints of existing sites.  A StratusLab
cloud can be deployed on a single physical machine.

See the documents below for installing the software from binary
packages.  Source code and manual installation instructions are
available from our [GitHub
repositories](https://github.com/StratusLab).

Information on the installation and use of the client software is
available in the [Try It](/try%20it) section.
