The StratusLab project was very much in evidence at the EGI Community Forum
last week in Munich. This year EGI had a very strong cloud computing track,
with a full-day programme on Wednesday covering user and infrastructure
experiences, followed by a lively discussion. Dr. Christophe Blanchet gave a
presentation entitled "Cloud, Ready for Bioinformatics?" as part of the cloud
users session where he discussed the experiences of French bioinformaticians
using StratusLab for scientific computing. Mr. Vangelis Floros looked at the
costs of cloud versus traditional computing in his talk "Operating a Public
Cloud with StratusLab" in the cloud infrastructure session, where Mr. John
Walsh from StratusLab partner TCD also discussed his experiences using
StratusLab in his talk "Supporting grid-enabled GPU workloads using rCUDA and
StratusLab".

Thursday morning saw a StratusLab Tutorial which was well-attended with
approximately 20 participants. This was followed by a presentation by Dr.
Charles Loomis as part of the cloud technolgoy session, entitled "StratusLab:
Use Cases, Features, and Sustainability".

The project booth in the exhibition area was busy throughout the week, with
posters describing Agile Development, Cloud Applications, IaaS Cloud
Distribution and Trusted Appliances which attracted a lot of interest from
conference attendees.
