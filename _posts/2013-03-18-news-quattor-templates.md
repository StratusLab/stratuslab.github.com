In addition to the scripted installation of StratusLab, our cloud
software can also be installed via [Quattor][quattor].  A short
two-day workshop will be held in Orsay, France (in English) to show
how to use the StratusLab Quattor configuration, to refine them for
use on multiple sites, and to validate them with deployments at the
participants' sites.

The [skeleton agenda][agenda] is available; please register on that
page if you will participate in the meeting.  The workshop will be
quite informal, concentrating on getting the StratusLab Quattor
configuration working for the participants.
