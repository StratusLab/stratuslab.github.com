category: review
---

StratusLab announces **version 2.1 of its IaaS cloud distribution**.
This release improves and streamlines the previous 2.0 release.  It
has been put together by the StratusLab collaboration that grew out of
the previous EC-funded project and that continues to evolve and
support the StratusLab cloud distribution.

Key features of StratusLab v2.1
-------------------------------

* Streamlined release, with the **removal of obsolete components**
  like the web monitor and the appliance repository.

* Move of Claudia and associated monitoring code to separate
  distribution support by the 4CaaST project.

* **More modular scripted installation**, allowing individual services
  to be installed as well as a complete cloud.

* Better support for specifying **virtio drivers** to obtain **better
  disk and network performance**.

* Created **images can be uploaded to persistent disk storage**,
  removing the need for external storage for machine images.

* **More robust interactions** with the iSCSI server to ensure better
  consistency across services.

* Refactoring of code to move to 'native' backend for metadata
  entries.  Support for mysql and postgres has been removed.

* Marketplace **utility to rebuild the database** from raw metadata
  entries.

* Improved Marketplace notification emails.

* **Bug fixes** across all of the code to ensure a better user
    experience.

* Supported on **CentOS 6.2** and **OpenSuSE 12.1**, two operating
  systems with longterm vendor support.

ScientificLinux, Fedora, Ubuntu, and OpenSuSE.  These have been
