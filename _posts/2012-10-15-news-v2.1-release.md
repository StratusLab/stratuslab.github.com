category: review
---

StratusLab announces version 2.1 of its IaaS cloud distribution.  This
release improves and streamlines the previous 2.0 release.  It has
been put together by the StratusLab collaboration that grew out of the
previous EC-funded project and that continues to evolve and support
the StratusLab cloud distribution.

Key features of StratusLab v2.1
-------------------------------

* Bug-fixes and enhancements to persistent disk support
* Support for new Operating Systems: OpenSuSE 12.1 and CentOS 6.2

Using a StratusLab Cloud
------------------------

The command line client and web interfaces for services are very
similar to previous releases.  For information about getting started,
see the ["Try It"][tryit] section of the website.

Installing a StratusLab Cloud
-----------------------------

Resource providers install your own public or private cloud with
StratusLab 2.1. Find all the documentation and instructions for
downloading and installing the software in the website "Install"
section.

Marketplace and Appliances
--------------------------

The StratusLab Marketplace lists ready-to-run virtual machine images,
prepared by the StratusLab collaboration and by others.  The
StratusLab images operating systems like ttylinux, CentOS,
ScientificLinux, Fedora, Ubuntu, and OpenSuSE.  

Other collaborations provide images for the UMD software, Globus
services, and bioinformatics appliances.  You can similarly provide
your images to share with others.
