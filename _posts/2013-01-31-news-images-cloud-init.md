We are happy to announce that the latest versions of all the Linux
distributions from the Marketplace: Ubuntu, CentOS, Fedora, Debian,
openSUSE, and Scientific Linux, allow both [CloudInit][ci-docs] and
the StratusLab standard contextualization mechanisms.  Endorsed by
"hudson builder", these images are identified in the [Marketplace][mp]
by their identifier.

* openSUSE v12.2 x86_64  IVoKMNC3iAXFVYzY-dGY-43MovC
* Ubuntu v12.04 x86_64   Ofmuq_hg5yUNIZFUIIIRQhiJm5E
* SL v6.3 x86_64         HaFFAa0EHw-mB0a9bu3FPzSxLEf
* Debian v7 x86_64       JU0WjIeUclzryhpFSUJMWiInNrh
* Fedora v18 x86_64      NhKuXe2vpdjOibeuU-ysvOAYglz
* CentOS v6.3 x86_64     IRei7LKvxoWVRsiiup2cz3-sSsk

This new feature can be used from the 13.02 versions of the client and
services.
