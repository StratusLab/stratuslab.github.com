CloudInit contextualization support in the StratusLab virtual machine
base images. We are happy to announce that all the Linux distributions
from the Marketplace: Ubuntu, CentOS, Fedora, Debian, openSUSE, and
Scientific Linux, latest version allows now both CloudInit and
StratusLab Standard Contextualization mechanisms.  Endorsed by "hudson
builder", these images are identified in the Marketplace by their
identifier.

* openSUSE v12.2 x86_64  IVoKMNC3iAXFVYzY-dGY-43MovC
* Ubuntu v12.04 x86_64   Ofmuq_hg5yUNIZFUIIIRQhiJm5E
* SL v6.3 x86_64         HaFFAa0EHw-mB0a9bu3FPzSxLEf
* Debian v7 x86_64       JU0WjIeUclzryhpFSUJMWiInNrh
* Fedora v18 x86_64      NhKuXe2vpdjOibeuU-ysvOAYglz
* CentOS v6.3 x86_64     IRei7LKvxoWVRsiiup2cz3-sSsk

This new feature could be tested once the StratusLab version 13.02 released.
