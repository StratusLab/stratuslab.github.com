title: StratusLab Version 2.1.2 Released
category: review
---

StratusLab announces **version 2.1.2 of its IaaS cloud distribution**.
This is a bug-fix release, fixing in particular, problems with the
image creation facilities.  (See the [image creation
tutorial][image-create-doc].)  The full list of changes is listed
below.

This release also includes a preview support for [CloudInit][ci-docs]
contextualization.  This is a flexible system used by several cloud
distributions and by many images within AWS.  See the
[documentation][cloudinit-doc] for an example of how to use it, try it
out, and provide feedback.

StratusLab installations of v2.1.x can be updated simply by installing
the updated packages in the yum repositories.  Clients can also just
download the new version and install it; the configuration is
compatible with previous versions.
