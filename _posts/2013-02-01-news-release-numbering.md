title: New Release Policy and Numbering
category: review
---

The StratusLab collaboration has decided to make 4 primary releases a
year.  Along with this, the StratusLab releases will now sport an
ubuntu-style numbering with year and month.  The first release with
this style will be 13.02 at the beginning of February.  Subsequent
releases will appear every three months afterwards.

We hope that this will make the timing of the StratusLab releases
clearer for everyone.  The releases will contain bug fixes and new
functionality that is available as of the release date.  Secondary
releases to patch important bugs may still be made between the primary
releases.

Feedback on the release policy and on how we communicate changes in
the the StratusLab distribution are welcome!  Send the feedback to
[support][about] or in the [user forum][forum].
