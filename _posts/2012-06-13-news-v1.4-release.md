---

The StratusLab project is proud to announce the StratusLab 1.4 release. This
is an incremental release of the StratusLab distribution, the cloud computing
distribution designed for grid and cluster computing.

Key features of StratusLab v1.4
-------------------------------

* Bug-fixes and enhancements to persistent disk support
* Introduction of support for the Telef√≥nica TCloud API which extends some of
  the main standards in cloud management, such as the OVF and vCloud
  specifications
* Support for new Operating Systems: OpenSuSE 12.1 and CentOS 6.2


Important notes for Upgrading from v1.3
---------------------------------------

Release 1.4 must be used with the StratusLab client version 1.21 distributed
with the release. Please upgrade your clients when you move to 1.4.

Before upgrading the pdisk service, you should back up the disk information in
/tmp/zookeeper. If you upgrade the service without rebooting the machine, then
the information will be moved from /tmp/zookeeper to /var/lib/zookeeper-pdisk
automatically. If you reboot the machine, you'll need to copy the backup
information into /var/lib/zookeeper-pdisk manually.

In addition to Fedora 14 packages, packages for OpenSuSE 12.1 and CentOS 6.2
are now also provided, please note however, that they have received less
testing than the standard Fedora 14 packages.

You can find more information on upgrading [here][upgrading].
