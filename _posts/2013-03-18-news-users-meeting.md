Last week the StratusLab developers got together in Orsay, France to
map out the evolution of the StratusLab cloud distribution.  This
roadmap will be presented at a StratusLab Users Meeting on 4 April
2013.

The [event][agenda] will be held at LAL in Orsay, France and will take
place in French.  This is an opportunity for those in the area to see
what the future holds and to provide feedback.  **Please register on
the [agenda page][agenda] if you plan to attend.**

For those who can't attend (or who don't speak French!), the roadmap
will be posted on the website.  As always, we welcome feedback via the
support mailing list (support@stratuslab.eu).
