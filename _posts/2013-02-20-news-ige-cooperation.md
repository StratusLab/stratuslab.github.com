The Initiative for Globus in Europe (IGE) is a project providing
European researchers with the tools to share computing power,
databases, instruments, and other on-line tools.  StratusLab has been
cooperating with the IGE project, to see how grid and cloud
technologies can benefit from each other.

[IGE][ige-web] has made Globus appliances available in the [StratusLab
Marketplace][marketplace].  Moreover, they've used those images and
the StratusLab reference cloud infrastructure to certify their
software and train users.  This effort shows how clouds can be used as
a foundation for other services and how the dynamic provisioning can
be an excellent solution to temporary training infrastructures.  Find
out more from the [news article][ige-sl-news] on the [IGE
website][ige-web].
