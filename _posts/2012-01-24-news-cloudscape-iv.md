The StratusLab project will have a strong presence at the upcoming Cloudscape
IV event which takes place in Brussels, Belgium from 23-24 February, 2012.

Cloudscape IV focuses strongly on interoperability and portability issues with
the involvement of key Standard Development Organizations as part of a call
for action to strengthen international cooperation to address global
challenges. Cloudscape IV also shines the spotlight on the reusable assets of
European Distributed Computing Infrastructures and the need to foster
synergies beyond the typical research infrastructure landscape. The event also
sees the launch of the SIENA European Roadmap on Grid and Cloud Standards for
e-Science and Beyond.

StratusLab member and OpenNebula Project Director, Dr. Ignacio M. Llorente,
will present a session entitled "Open-source and Standards - Unleashing the
Potential for Innovation of Cloud Computing", while StratusLab's
Infrastructure Operations WP leader, Vangelis Floros, will give a short
presentation as part of a round-table discussion among the DCI projects.

Catch up with the StratusLab team at this key event on the cloud computing
calendar.
