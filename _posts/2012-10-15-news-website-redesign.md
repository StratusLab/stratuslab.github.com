The StratusLab collaboration has redesigned its website.  The new
design makes for easy navigation on desktops, tablets, and
smartphones.  The content has been streamlined, allowing StratusLab
users and system administrators to find the information they need
quickly.

Web Design
----------

The [ShinyFrog][shinyfrog] designed the look-and-feel of the website.
The navigation is big and bold to make finding things quick and easy.
The colors are muted to make reading the documentation more pleasant.

System administrators should look in the ["Install"][install] section
for information on installing and running the StratusLab services.
Users should look in the ["Try It"][tryit] section to get started.

Support and other contacts can be found in the ["About"][about]
section.

Feedback
--------

We'll be updating the website and adding content regularly.  [Let us
know][about] what you think and what information you'd like to see.
