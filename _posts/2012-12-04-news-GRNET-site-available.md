We are happy to announce the availability again of StratusLab's second public site running in GRNET, Athens, Greece. The site has been re-installed from scratch with the latest release (2.1.1) of the StratusLab distribution and it offers a total of 256 CPU cores, 288 GB of main memory and 3 TB of storage. All previous user accounts have been preserved, thus existing users can start using it immediately with their credentials. The frontend hostname has remained the same (cloud.grnet.stratuslab.eu).
