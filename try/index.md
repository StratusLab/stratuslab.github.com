Two partners of the StratusLab collaboration maintain production cloud
infrastructures using our software.  Test accounts can be obtained to
access these services and try out the functionality of the StratusLab
cloud distribution.

Try the software!  This section tells you how to register for the
reference infrastructures, use the web interface, and install and use
the command line client.  You can also browse the source code in our
[GitHub repositories](https://github.com/StratusLab).
